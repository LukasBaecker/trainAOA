                  The protection and security of personal data is a top priority
                  for us. Therefore, we strictly adhere to the rules of the
                  German Federal Data Protection Act (BDSG). In the following,
                  you will be informed about what type of data is collected and
                  for what purpose:

                <b>1. Data transmission / Data logging</b>
                <br /> When you visit this page, the Web-Serve automatically
                records log files that cannot be assigned to a specific person.
                These data include e.g. B. the browser type and version,
                operating system used, referrer URL (the previously visited
                page), IP address of the requesting computer, access date and
                time of the server request and the file request of the client
                (file name and URL). This data is only collected for statistical
                analysis. It will not be passed on to third parties for
                commercial or non-commercial purposes.
                <br />
                <b>2. Use of personal data</b>
                <br />
                Personal data is only collected or processed if you this
                information is voluntary, e.g. in the context of an inquiry. If
                there are no necessary reasons in connection with a business
                transaction, you can revoke the previously granted approval of
                your personal data storage at any time with immediate effect in
                writing (e.g. by email or fax). Your data will not be passed on
                to third parties, unless a transfer is required due to legal
                regulations.
                <br />
                <b>3. Information, change and deletion of your data</b>
                <br /> In accordance with applicable law, you can ask us in
                writing at any time whether and which personal data we have
                stored about you. You will receive a corresponding notification
                immediately.
                <br />
                <b>4. Security of your data</b>
                <br /> Your personal data provided to us will be secured by
                taking all technical and organizational security measures so
                that they are inaccessible to access by unauthorized third
                parties. When sending very sensitive data or information, it is
                advisable to use the postal service, as complete data security
                by email cannot be guaranteed.
                <br />
                <b>5. Changes to this privacy policy</b>
                <br /> We will update this policy to protect your personal
                information from time to time. You should check out these
                guidelines from time to time to keep up to date with how we
                protect your information and continually improve the content of

                use and / or disclosure of the personal data you have provided
                to us, we will draw your attention to this by means of a clear
                and clearly visible notice on the website. By using the website,
